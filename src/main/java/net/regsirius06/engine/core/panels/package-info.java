/**
 * This package contains classes for creating and managing graphical panels for the labyrinth game.
 * <p>
 * The main class in this package is {@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.panels.LabyrinthPanel},
 * which is responsible for rendering the labyrinth and handling user input for player movement.
 * The panel provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the labyrinth game, allowing interaction
 * via key events and displaying a mini-map and graphical elements such as light sources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The package also contains base classes such as {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractLabyrinthPanel},
 * which provide a foundation for creating labyrinth-related panels, and {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractPanel},
 * which provides a foundation for custom {@link javax.swing.JPanel} implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package is part of the larger engine responsible for simulating and rendering labyrinth environments,
 * including the logic for player movement, world generation, and rendering.
 * </p>
