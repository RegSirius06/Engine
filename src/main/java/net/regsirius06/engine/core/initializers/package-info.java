/**
 * This package contains the initializers responsible for creating and configuring different game panels, 
 * specifically related to the labyrinth world. The classes within this package provide the functionality 
 * to initialize the labyrinth world, handle key logic, and customize various properties of the labyrinth panel.
 *
 * <p>Initializers are used to create and configure various panels or game world components. In this package,
 * the primary focus is on the labyrinth world creation process. Each initializer is responsible for ensuring
 * that the required parameters are correctly passed and providing default or custom behavior for the world setup.
 *
 * <p>The main initializer in this package is {@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.initializers.LabyrinthPanelInit}, 
 * which is specifically designed to instantiate and initialize {@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.panels.LabyrinthPanel}
 * objects with customized settings such as dimensions, light quantity, randomization seed, and key logic handling.
 *
 * <p>These initializers are part of a modular system where different labyrinth configurations can be selected 
 * or extended by plugins and other parts of the application.
