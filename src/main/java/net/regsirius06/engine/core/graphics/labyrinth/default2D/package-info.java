/**
 * Provides the classes and logic for rendering a 2D labyrinth environment with raycasting effects.
 * This package includes classes responsible for visualizing the player's perspective of the labyrinth,
 * including light sources, reflections, and walls.
 * <p>
 * The key class in this package is {@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.labyrinth.default2D.LabyrinthGraphics2D},
 * which implements the ray casting logic to simulate how the player sees the world based on their position and orientation.
 * <p>
 * This package is part of the larger engine that simulates a 2D labyrinth world, and it is designed to be extendable
 * for rendering different types of 2D environments with ray casting features.
