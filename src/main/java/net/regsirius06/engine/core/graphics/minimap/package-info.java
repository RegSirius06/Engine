 * The minimap displays a simplified representation of the labyrinth environment,
 * including walls, light sources, and the player's position.
 * <p>
 * This package provides the {@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.minimap.MiniMap} class,
 * which is responsible for rendering the minimap in a 2D graphics context.
 * The minimap helps in visualizing the labyrinth layout and aiding the player in navigation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The minimap is scaled to fit within a specified area, and its content includes walls
 * (rendered according to their state and color), light sources (highlighted with circles),
 * and the player's position (marked with a red circle).
