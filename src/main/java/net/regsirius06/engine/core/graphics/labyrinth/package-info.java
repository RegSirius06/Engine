/**
 * Contains classes related to the labyrinth environment and rendering of 2D labyrinth scenes.
 * The classes in this package manage the labyrinth's structure, light sources, and player interaction.
 * <p>
 * This package provides utilities for creating, managing, and rendering labyrinths with dynamic interactions and visual effects.
 * The labyrinth structure is designed to be used in conjunction with ray casting algorithms and 2D rendering techniques.
 * <p>
 * This package serves as a foundational part of the engine, allowing for complex labyrinth simulations and visualization.
