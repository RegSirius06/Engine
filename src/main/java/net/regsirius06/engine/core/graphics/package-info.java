/**
 * Contains classes and utilities for rendering, manipulating, and applying effects to colors and graphics.
 * This package provides essential components for graphical operations such as color manipulation, raycasting,
 * labyrinth rendering, minimap visualization, and geometric calculations in the 2D Cartesian plane.
 * <p>
 * Key components of this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.MathColor} - A class for precise color manipulation using floating-point RGB values.</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.Filter} - A utility class for performing color filtering operations such as mixing and applying masks.</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.labyrinth} - Classes related to the labyrinth environment and rendering 2D labyrinth scenes.</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.labyrinth.default2D} - Provides raycasting-based 2D labyrinth rendering.</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.minimap} - Contains classes responsible for rendering a 2D minimap of the labyrinth.</li>
 *   <li>{@link net.regsirius06.engine.core.graphics.rays} - Includes classes for working with 2D lines in Cartesian coordinates.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The package enables dynamic interaction with 2D labyrinth simulations, visual effects such as light sources and reflections,
 * and geometric operations for environment rendering. It is designed for ease of extension, providing tools for further customization
 * and optimization for graphics and rendering tasks.
