/**
 * Provides classes related to the representation and manipulation of 2D lines in the Cartesian plane.
 * <p>
 * This package includes the {@link Line2D} class, which provides a variety of methods for working with
 * lines in 2D space. The {@link Line2D} class supports operations such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defining a line using slope and y-intercept, two points, or an angle and a point</li>
 *   <li>Calculating the y-coordinate for a given x-coordinate (and vice versa)</li>
 *   <li>Determining the angle of the line relative to the x-axis</li>
 *   <li>Rotating the line around a specified point</li>
 *   <li>Calculating the perpendicular (normal) line to the given line</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are primarily used for geometric calculations and raycasting algorithms,
 * particularly in the context of rendering and simulating environments such as labyrinths.
 * </p>
