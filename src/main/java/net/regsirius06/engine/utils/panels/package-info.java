/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for rendering and managing graphical panels within the application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes abstract base classes like {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractPanel}
 * and {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractLabyrinthPanel}
 * for creating custom panels that support 2D rendering and handle key input events. These panels are typically
 * used to render labyrinths and handle user interactions through keyboard events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractPanel} class implements
 * the {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.Drawable2D} interface, providing a foundation for custom rendering
 * on panels. The {@link net.regsirius06.engine.utils.panels.AbstractLabyrinthPanel} extends this and adds
 * functionality for handling key events, making it suitable for labyrinth-related panels that require user input
 * for navigation and interaction.
 * </p>
